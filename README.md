## Organizations
- [Data Science for Social Good](http://www.dssgfellowship.org/): The Data Science for Social Good Fellowship is a full-time summer program to train aspiring data scientists to work on machine learning, data science, and AI projects with social impact in a fair and equitable manner. Working closely with governments and nonprofits, fellows take on real-world problems in education, health, criminal justice, sustainability, public safety, workforce development, human services, transportation, economic development, international development, and more.
- [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/): DrivenData works on projects at the intersection of data science and social impact, in areas like international development, health, education, research and conservation, and public services. We want to give more organizations access to the capabilities of data science, and engage more data scientists with social challenges where their skills can make a difference.
- [DataKind](https://www.datakind.org/):We bring together top data scientists with leading social change organizations to collaborate on cutting-edge analytics and advanced algorithms to maximize social impact. Our programs build upon one another and are designed to meet organizations where they are. From evening or weekend events to multi-month projects, all are designed to provide social organizations with the pro bono data science innovation team they need to tackle critical humanitarian issues in the fields of education, poverty, health, human rights, the environment and cities. 
- [Data & Society](https://datasociety.net/): Data & Society advances public understanding of the social implications of data-centric technologies and automation.
- [Data + the Greater Good Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/greatergood/): For anyone who is interested in how data can benefit humanity and the environment. We'll meet once a month around how data intersects healthcare, education, social justice, economic empowerment, the arts, and the environment.
